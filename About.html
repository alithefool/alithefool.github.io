        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Alex a tech explorer from Zaragoza, Spain, with a love for all things math, code, and retro tech. I’ve always been drawn to the way logic and creativity intersect, whether it’s through programming or diving into early 2000s hardware. My journey in tech feels a bit like fixing a broken machine: challenging, but incredibly satisfying when all the pieces fit.</p>
    
        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>I like to bring math to life through code. My projects range from visual experiments like ASCII displays using matrix projections, to exploring cellular automata and how simple rules create complex systems. Each project is like a puzzle, and solving it is what keeps me hooked.</p>
    
        <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
        <p>I’m looking to dive deeper into cybersecurity and collaborate on projects that challenge my skills and spark creativity. Whether it’s cracking a tough problem or building something that blends tech and art, I’m all about creating things that are as innovative as they are fun. Let’s connect and make some cool stuff together!!</p>
