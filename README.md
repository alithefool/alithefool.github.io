# alithefool.github.io


This is a small portfolio website to show off some of my fun little projects in photography filmmaking and all stuff programming, made it mostly as a graphic design endeavor and a way to try and make a site that looks great with only HTML+CSS however as ive gone on with it its turned into a pinbook of various projects and doohickeys so there is some JS spruced in for certain features i found fun, a readme dosent seem too important for a personal site however i would like to place a couple of disclamers!

-If you use my photos, please credit me
-DO NOT USE THIS SITE ON MOBILE, im going for a 4:3 look for the site and it DOES NOT translate to mobile so it looks like shit and dosent work properly
-If ur reading this follow me on github! :)
